### Who is John Henry Mejía?

A pretty regular dude who's just a little bit too curious. This curiosity of his brings him great joy but also great struggle - as he can rarely sit still. So he always studies something, creates something, explores the great outdoors, exercises, walks (and thinks), reads, cycles, or writes his thoughts in a little notebook that he always carries around.

Yep, that's pretty much me. Hello! Hi! Nice to meet you :)

### What am I up to these days?

Currently I am living in Fort Worth working at Lockheed Martin Aeronautics on the F-22. Alongside my work, I'm a coach for the [TCU Rowing Team](https://tcurowing.com) and part of the [Fort Worth Rowing Club](https://fortworthrowing.org/). 

### What can you find on this page?

I intend to use this tiny piece of internet for my personal thinking, reflections, learning and sharing of knowledge. Thus, you should be able to find here essays, journal entries, notes, poems and any other format I find fitting for the occasion. Thanks for visiting and don't hesitate to reach out if you think we have something in common! I'd love to connect with cool folks on the other side of the network. Peace ✌︎
